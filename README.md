# Know How

You know how to do things. People around you know how to do things. Together, you should know how to do more than the sum of your know-hows.

## Platform is gucci, "know how" is geico

AI Platforms are bought and sold as if they are the answer to all. Innovation, Optimization, "*"-tion. 

Your platform is only as good as the people who use it.
Your operating procedures ("know how") is your biggest asset. 
Platforms can fail, they can become your competition, they can be your biggest liability.
"Know how" encoded in your people is the only thing that can't be bought or sold. 
The collective knowledge of how to do things is the only thing that can't be commoditized.

> Investing and developing "know how" is your insurance policy in a market where everyone has a "platform".

## Axioms of "Know How"

### Workflows are not flows, they are maelstroms

Being in enterprise I have always loathe and loved the word "workflow". Having built platforms over and over, I know for a fact that:

#### How things happen are not how things are done

Operations are never a flow. They are a maelstrom of decisions, exceptions, and human interactions. Building AI on a flow is a fool's errand. Developing AI on how things are done is the only way to make it useful. Leveraing that to connect the dots of your operations is the only way to make it an alpha. A unique implementation your competition can't buy.

#### Don't throw out the alpha with the hype

It's tempting to be binary on gen ai. It's either the future or it's a fad. There is a middle ground.
A practical stance for you to corner your market and expand from what you know how to do better than anyone else.
